 The Perfect Guess

A **fun and interactive Python game** where the program thinks of a number between 1 and 100, and you try to guess it. With each attempt, you’ll get hints to go higher or lower until you find the correct number.  

 How It Works
- The program generates a **random number** between 1 and 100.  
- You enter your guesses one by one.  
- After each guess, the program tells you whether the number is **higher** or **lower**.  
- Keep guessing until you hit the **perfect number**!  
- The game counts how many guesses it took — challenge yourself to guess it in as few tries as possible!  

 Features
- **Randomized numbers** every game for a unique experience.  
- **Interactive hints** make it fun and challenging.  
- **Tracks attempts** for better self-challenge.  
- **Lightweight and beginner-friendly** Python code.
