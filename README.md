# 🎯 The Perfect Guess

A **fun and interactive Python game** where the program thinks of a number between 1 and 100, and you try to guess it. With each attempt, you’ll get hints to go higher or lower until you find the correct number.

## 🕹️ How It Works
- The program generates a **random number** between 1 and 100.  
- You enter your guesses one by one.  
- After each guess, the program tells you whether the number is **higher** or **lower**.  
- Keep guessing until you hit the **perfect number**!  
- The game counts how many guesses it took — challenge yourself to guess it in as few tries as possible!
